        <p id="content">In the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, 
            two opponents randomly toss out hand 
            gestures, and each one wins, loses or 
            draws with equal probability. It's 
            supposed to be a game of pure luck, 
            not skill and each one wins, loses or 
            draws with equal probability. Each win will earn
            one point and the one who gets 10 points first
            will be the winner.</p>
